# Regex Tutorial 	 | ‚úâÔ∏è Email Matching

(brought to you by: Muhammad Shehroz, August 21st 2022)

In this tutorial I will be discussing the wonderful world of regular expressions, aka Regex. A Regex is a set of characters that together make a pattern. They can by used inside of code or algorithms to locate, or even locate and replace if that's what you desire, specific patterns inside of a string. An example of this would be to validate a user's password, identify phone numbers, email addresses, URLs, and so much more.

## Summary :electron:

Moving forward we will be disecting, with consent from the Regex of course, that is being used to locate( as well as verify) an email address. Our volunteer is:</br> 

`\b[a-z0-9#$_-]+@[a-z0-9]+\.[a-z]{2,3}\b/gi`</br>

## üê∏ Email Validation Breakdown 
The breakdown of our brave Regex `\b[a-z0-9#$_-]+@[a-z0-9]+\.[a-z]{2,3}\b/gi`:

- The Alpha and the Omega(the beginning and the end) of it is of course the `\b`. That portion is called the "word boundaries". That states that the expression needs to be matched as a stand-alone word( or string if you're nasty). A good example would be the enclosed parenthesis, without separating spaces, their validation most certainly will fail as it will not match.

- The very 1st group `[a-zA-Z0-9#$_-]+` matches up any upper/lower case letter, any number, as well as the characters `#$_-`. The `-` used between the "a" and "z" provides the requirement of any letter between those two. On that note, the `0-9` means the same regarding numbers. The plus(`+`) sign(AKA a quantifier) after the closing bracket states that any of those characters before it can occur one time or more than one, an example would be `Rowdy_roddy388`. The square brackets are known as a "character class", which I will explain a bit further down. You may wonder how the Regex knows to identify both upper and lower case letters, to that I answer with a spotlight on that little `i` flag right at the end of it all. We'll also go into that below.

- After that is the `@`. The `@` is required for emails, nothing fancy needed there.

- The following group is `[a-z0-9]+` which also matches any upper/lower case letter, any number, and let's not forget the lovely `+` flag outside of the brackets. So if they have a username from somewhere like `nada1` it's all good, as the kids say, in the hood.

- Following that would be the `\.`, which is simply the dot before the extension(`com`,`gov`,`ca`, etc.,) escaped.

- Last, but certainly not least, is the `[a-z]{2,3}` which houses the extension. Which as you may have guessed is a two parter. The first part `[a-z]` you can probably guess what this is for, but let me secure your guess, yes it is the same as the 1st 2 parts. It simply is indicating the characters within the range of `a` to `z` and `A` to `Z`. The `{2,3}`(a fixed quantifier) is a new one for you. This is simply defining the minimum and maximum length for that extension. Some other examples would be `au`(Australia), `edu`(A school!), and `dd`(Germany).

- By their powers combined, they form `Rowdy_roddy388``@``nada1``.``com` or simple `Rowdy_roddy388@nada1.com`!

- I will include an image showing the validation in "action". Not only does the legendary `Rowdy_roddy388@nada1.com` make an appearance as proof pudding prime, but there are 2 other emails that can be seen passing(all highlighted in blue), plus one that didn't make the cut(It's kinda easy to see which failed). I also provided a JavaScript code that can be used via your browser's dev tool if you want to try it there, I also included a screenshot showing the ones that passed and failed(true = pass, false = fail).

### ‚öì	 Anchors

The Regex, as stated earlier in this tutorial, begins with `\b`. This is called an anchor and it's job is to define a "word boundary". By using this at the beginning/end we are forcing what's called a "whole word" search. So for example, if the Regex was `\b867530\b`, then only `867530` would match up but not `8675309`, which as we all know would ruin the famous 1981 rock hit by Tommy Tutone.

Some other anchors are `^` and `$`:

^XXXXX will match any string that starts with ^XXXXX

XXXXX$ will match any string that ends with XXXXX$

Anchors are just a type of "meta-character". They don't match any characters, but instead they match specific positions. As you just saw `^` matches the starting position right before the 1st character of the search string. On the other hand `$` matches the end of the last character, and of course `\b` defines the entire boundary for the search string itself.

### üì° Quantifiers

This sci-fi sounding portion is best simplified as a repeater. A quantifier repeats the previous item zero, 1, or more times. There are a fairly large list of quantifiers, but let's stick with the one we've already used. The `+` is part of that group, which states that the previous item(the collection of characters) can be repeated multiple times. They are also known as a "greedy quantifier" due to the fact that an item can be matched multiple times.

As we reviewed above, `{2,3}` is a fixed quantifier. This one specifically states that the search must be between 2 and 3 characters.

There are also simpler quantifiers, `{3,}` is a good example. This simply states that the preceding item repeats at least 2 times. This is an example of the "greedy quantifier" due to the fact that an item can be matched multiple times.


### üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Character Classes üßù

No we aren't talking about your D&D half-orc Grumblethrust, we are referring to the the characters inside the square brackets. Those characters inside are the ones being matched, for example `[abceasyas123]` which will match `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`,`a`,`s`,`y`,`a`,`s`,`1`,`2`, or `3`. Seems like a lot, right? Well there's a <b>way</b> easier way to do lengthier parts, above you may have seen `[a-z]`, that states that <i>any</i> character between `a` and `z` will match(we ensured that both upper/lower case will also match with the `i` flag at the end). You can even get fancy like this `[a-z[aeiou]]` and match only the consonants, excluding every vowel!


### üè¥Û†ÅµÛ†Å≥Û†Å∞Û†Å≤Û†Åø Flags

This one we have gone over several times, but let's do a quick review. An example of a flag for Regex is that lovely `i` at the end of `\b[a-z0-9#$_-]+@[a-z0-9]+\.[a-z]{2,3}\b/i`, that's what prevents us from having to type out `\b[a-zA-Z0-9#$_-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}\b/i`(note the addition of `A-Z`, with the `i` we don't need to put that in there as the flag provides that for us!). Now there's one other flag to keep in mind, that's the `g` flag. The `g` flag by itself provides a global search for the Regex definition matches, but you will have to include those pesky upper cases. How to resolve this you may be asking? Create the most ambitious cross-over event since Avengers: Endgame, add `gi`. That covers global searches AND upper/lower casing. üåà‚≠ê

### üí¢ Bracket Expressions üí•

Brackets are pretty simple, these `[]` simply define the character class. Any characters placed inside them will produce a match to the Regex pattern, unless of course the negate character(`^`) precedes the characters in the class. In the Regex example above `[a-z]` defines any character class that is within the alphabet (let's not forget we are including both upper/lower cases due to that lovely `i`).

### üí∞ Greedy and Lazy Match ü•±

The general concept of greedy and lazy quantifiers is related to the usage of quantifiers and what is being matched. A greedy quantifier matches as many items as possible like the Scrooge McDuck of searches, such as the `+` used above. A lazy match will attempt to match a Regex pattern just once, like an R2 droid with a bad motivator, and then it's done with that way.

### üö™ Boundaries

Boundaries are important in and outside of code, but we're talking strictly about code here. The example that is defining the "red light/green light" for our example above is the `\b` at the start and end of the Regex. This indicates that a match will only occur if the string is matched in isolation, AKA is a whole word. To beat the digital horse mentioned above, if the Regex was `\b867530\b`, then not only do we ruin a great song, but it will never match up with `8675309` only `867530`.
